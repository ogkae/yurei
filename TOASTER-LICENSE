Permission is hereby granted, completely free (because who even pays for
code anymore?), to any programmer, student, bootcamp survivor, or confused
startup founder who discovers this software (the "Software"), to do basically
whatever they want with it, including but not limited to:
       - Running it on your toaster of a PC and claiming it's "high performance".
       - Copying and pasting it into your GitHub repo without touching a line.
       - Uploading YouTube videos as “hacker tutorials” for skids or kids
         who only copy-paste from GPT.
       - Selling it as a “premium API” for $9.99/month and calling it SaaS.
       - Deploying it and blaming Docker/Kubernetes when it breaks.
       - Making endless memes about it on Discord, Reddit, or your Slack.

All the above is allowed, provided that:
       1. You include this hilarious notice somewhere in your repo or code,
          preferably hidden, so future generations can laugh at our chaos.
       2. You occasionally reflect on your life choices and maybe, just maybe,
          consider contributing to open source for genuine reasons.

DISCLAIMER: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR "WORKS ON MY TOASTER PC" GUARANTEES. In no event
shall the author, their GitHub account, or their coffee machine, be liable for
any rage quits, broken CI/CD pipelines, TikTok/YouTube skids tutorials, or
existential crises arising from the use of this Software.

Enjoy responsibly. Remember: 99% of startups fail, but your toaster PC +
this code can still shine gloriously on GitHub and in those cringe YouTube videos.
